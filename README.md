## Info

1. WhiteBIT API supports `private` and `public` methods.
2. Available API versions: `V1`, `V2`, `V4`.
3. Using **Public endpoints**:
    1. Public endpoints are cached. You can find specific cache refresh interval for each particular request in API documentation.
    2. Use HTTP method `GET` method when making a request.
    3. Use `query string` if you need to send additional data.
4. Using **Private endpoints**:
    1. To make private API calls:
        1. Go to your account on whitebit.com.
        2. Click on the API keys tab.
        3. Select the appropriate configuration tab for your API keys. Different API keys allow access to different API calls.
        4. Generate API keys and toggle the activation switcher to "Activated".
    2. Auth request should be using `POST` method and should include:
        1. Body data - **JSON** that includes:
            1. **'request'** - a request path without the domain name. Example: `'/api/v4/trade-account/balance'`.
            2. **'nonce'** - a number that is always **larger** than the previous requestâ€™s nonce number. Example: `'1594297865'`. A good method of creating a **nonce** is to use the unix timestamp in milliseconds. This way you'll always get an incrementing number, but make sure not to send two API calls at the same time, otherwise their nonce will be identical.
            3. **params of request** - Example: `'ticker': 'BTC'`
        2. Headers:
            1. `'Content-type': 'application/json'`
            2. `'X-TXC-APIKEY': api_key` - where api_key is your public WhiteBit API key
            3. `'X-TXC-PAYLOAD': payload'` - where payload is base64-encoded body data
            4. `'X-TXC-SIGNATURE': signature` - where signature is `hex(HMAC_SHA512(payload), key=api_secret))`
    3. To help you get started with our API, we've created the [API Quick start helper](https://github.com/whitebit-exchange/api-quickstart) library. It supports the following languages:
        1. ``Go``
        2. ``NodeJS``
        3. ``Python``
        4. ``PHP``
        4. ``Java``
        4. ``Kotlin``
